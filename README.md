# [![avoCart banner - Welcome to your smart shopping list!](public/og-img-lg.png 'avoCart')](https://tcl-22-shopping-list.web.app/)

[AvoCart](https://tcl-22-shopping-list.web.app/) is a smart shopping list that learns your buying habits and helps you remember what you need to buy on your next trip to the store.

Developed by participants of [The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes/)'s Spring 2021 cohort, using React.js, Firebase, Material UI, and Styled Components

## How does it work?

As a user, you will enter items (e.g., “Greek yogurt” or “Paper towels”) into your list. Each time you buy the item, you mark it as purchased in the list. Over time, the app comes to understand the intervals at which you buy different items. If an item is likely to be due to be bought soon, it rises to the top of the shopping list.
